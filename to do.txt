Add a new model to my code - include family size
check for collinearity
stepwise variable selection?
upload submission from the most accurate model
coefficients and pvalues?
loop for repeated actions during model evaluation
Plan and create a new clean version of the code which can be repeated on future projects
Ensure most common value is the one not included as a dummy variable

Plan:
-	Exploratory Data Analysis
-	Create one dataset with ALL variables, including non-dummy variables
-	Check for collinearity
-	Split data into specific datasets with required columns
-	Fit regression models
-   Use stepwise or backward variable selection
-	Use Kfold validation to determine the most accurate regression model
-	Use the most accurate regression model to add predictions to csv file for submission
